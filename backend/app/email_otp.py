"""Email OTP delivery, on top of the shared app.mailer transport.

Mirrors app/sms.py for the email channel. The OTP code itself is generated,
hashed, TTL-capped and single-use in app/routers/auth.py (the SAME machinery as
SMS); this module only builds the OTP subject/body and hands delivery off to
app.mailer. It never logs the code value.

Delivery transport (Brevo HTTPS API preferred, raw SMTP fallback) lives in
app.mailer: many hosts (including Render's free/starter tiers) block or
silently drop outbound SMTP ports (25/465/587), which raw SMTP hits as an
opaque connection timeout, so the HTTPS API is tried first when configured.

When neither transport is configured, is_configured() returns False and the
auth router restricts email OTP to the demo allowlist (returning 503 for
everyone else) instead of a silent bypass.

Founder note: set BREVO_API_KEY + SMTP_FROM (Brevo API path, recommended), or
SMTP_HOST/SMTP_PORT/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASSWORD/SMTP_FROM (SMTP path) as env vars.
