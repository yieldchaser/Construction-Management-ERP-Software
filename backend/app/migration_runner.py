"""
R2-731: Real migration runner that applies supabase/migrations/*.sql on startup.

Prior to this, supabase/migrations/*.sql were never executed by app code; README
instructed hand-pasting into Supabase editor. No Alembic, no script read that
directory, and D-V4 gate only checked file existence -- so R2-730 proved file
existence could be true while prod DB never received the change.

This runner closes the gap:
  - Discovers supabase/migrations/*.sql in sorted lexical order (chronological).
  - Tracks applied files in a supabase_migrations table (created if missing).
  - Executes pending files via raw SQL (single transaction per file).
  - Handles both SQLite (local dev) and Postgres (production):
      * SQLite: no-op execution but still tracks files so the gate can verify
        the runner was invoked; unique-constraint remediation for SQLite dev
        is handled by ensure_sqlite_unique_constraints().
      * Postgres: full execution with checksum and timing, idempotent via the
        migrations' own IF NOT EXISTS / DO-block guards plus tracking table.
  - Idempotent and safe to run on every boot; logs each applied migration.
  - Callable from backend/app/main.py lifespan and from scripts/apply_migrations.py
    for manual/CI invocation.

Blast-radius: new file; no existing table is dropped or altered beyond the
tracking table's CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
