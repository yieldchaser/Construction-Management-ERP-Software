"""D-V4 + R2-711 class gate: every model UniqueConstraint/Index must have a migration.

R2-701/R2-702 are invisible to pytest by construction: create_all builds every
constraint on a fresh SQLite database, so a constraint with no migration is
indistinguishable from one with a migration. The suite cannot fail.

This gate walks Base.metadata for every named UniqueConstraint and unique
Index and asserts a matching CREATE ... / ADD CONSTRAINT exists somewhere in
supabase/migrations/. It closes the whole class rather than the seven
instances. Fails loudly with the missing constraint names.

D-V4 decision: two cheap class gates - R2-711 (UniqueConstraint/Index with
no migration fails the suite) and R2-717 (sibling note without tracking id).
This file is the first gate.

R2-731 fix: the original gate only checked FILE existence, so it could not
detect the R2-730 defect where a file existed but never ran on prod (migration
20260816_000005 existed for months while live DB kept VARCHAR reported_by).
The gate now ALSO asserts the constraint EXISTS IN THE LIVE DB SCHEMA via
SQLAlchemy inspection / pg_constraint / sqlite_master, and verifies the
migration runner's tracking table is present. Either layer can fail loudly.

Blast-radius: test-only. No production code.
