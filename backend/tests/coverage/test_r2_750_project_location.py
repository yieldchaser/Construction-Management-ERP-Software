"""R2-750 - a project must be able to hold site coordinates, and a punch that
could not be measured must not be recorded as verified.

R2-475 filed the symptom ("a project with no site coordinates passes every
geofence check"). This finding is the root cause underneath it: there is no
supported way to give a project coordinates at all.

ProjectCreate lists 18 fields -- including attendance_radius_meters, defaulting
to 500 -- and `location` is not among them, nor is it in ProjectUpdate. The API
lets you configure a radius around a point it gives you no way to specify.
Measured in production: 7 of 7 projects have a null or empty location.

With location null, site_lat is always None, so `within_geofence` was
unconditionally True, distance was stored as NULL, and every punch was written
with location_verified=True and status "Present". That makes R2-474's fix inert:
correct code, zero effect, because there is nothing to compute against.
Attendance drives payroll and "GPS Verified" is an assurance shown to whoever
reviews the muster.

Three clauses: the create API accepts coordinates, the update API can add them
later, and an unmeasurable punch is recorded as unverified.
