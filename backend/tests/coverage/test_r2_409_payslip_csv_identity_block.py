"""R2-409 - the payslip CSV export carried no pay period, no payroll run id and no company/project, so the file could not be filed, archived or reconciled.

The exported header stopped at the money columns: `Days In Month 26` appeared
but the month did not, three same-named rows shared one name with nothing to
tell them apart, and there was no way to tie a downloaded file back to the run
that produced it. Employee Code had already been added by an earlier wave;
the schema-supported identity block (pay period, run id, company, project)
was still missing. PAN/PF/UAN/ESI numbers have no source columns on
StaffEmployee and remain a report-only gap.

Gate: every row now carries Pay Period, Payroll Run ID, Company and Project
(appended after the original columns so index-based readers keep working),
and same-named employees stay distinguishable through the employee-code
column including its per-row uuid fallback.
