/**
 * The GST states and union territories a project site can sit in.
 *
 * Project.state is not decoration. `POST /projects/` refuses to create a project
 * without it (projects.py: "Project.state is required for invoicing"), and
 * billing and quotation conversion refuse to run without it, because place of
 * supply derives from the site under IGST Act s.12(3). No project surface used
 * to collect the field at all, so no project could be created through the UI.
 *
 * Keep this list in step with _GST_STATE_CODE_MAP in backend/app/gst_utils.py.
 * The stored value is the name; project_state_code() lowercases and maps it.
 * Deprecated aliases in the backend map (Orissa, Puduchery, Andhra Pradesh New)
 * are intentionally not offered here.
